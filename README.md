## Introduction

The **Fashion Product Predictor Application** is a web-based tool designed to analyze fashion images and predict the types of fashion products present. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models, this application provides users with insights into fashion trends, helping both consumers and retailers make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images in PNG, JPG, or JPEG formats.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for efficient and accurate object detection.
- **Annotated Results:** Displays the uploaded image with detected fashion items highlighted.
- **Detection Counts:** Provides a summary of detected fashion components with their respective counts.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user experience.

## Demo

Experience the application live: [Fashion Product Predictor on Streamlit](https://fashion-product-predictor-app.streamlit.app/)

*Note: Replace the above link with your actual deployed Streamlit app URL.*

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit:** For building the web application interface.
- **Ultralytics YOLO:** For object detection and image analysis.
- **Pillow (PIL):** For image processing.
- **Git:** Version control.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** installed for version control. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-product-predictor.git
   cd fashion-product-predictor
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS and Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Download the YOLO Model**

   Ensure that you have the trained YOLO model (`best.pt`) in the project directory. If you don't have it, you can train your own model or download a pre-trained one.

   ```bash
   # Example command to download a pre-trained YOLO model
   wget https://path-to-your-model/best.pt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

### Steps to Use the Application

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - Click on the "Browse files" button.
   - Select an image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg`) from your computer.

2. **Analyze the Image:**
   - Once the image is uploaded, it will be displayed on the screen.
   - Click the "Analyse Image" button to start the detection process.

3. **View Results:**
   - The application will display the annotated image with detected fashion items highlighted.
   - A summary of detected components with their counts will be shown below the image.
